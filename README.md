<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<h3>About me</h3>
<p>
I’m a 17-year-old IT apprentice based in Switzerland, passionate about building software.
I create web and desktop applications with a strong focus on backend systems, clean architecture, and security.
Most of my work revolves around APIs, internal tools, and long-term projects where maintainability actually matters.
